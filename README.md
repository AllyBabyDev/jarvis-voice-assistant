Status: Planning
Category: AI • Desktop Tools • Voice Interaction


🖼️ Project Banner

Your personal AI companion — always listening, always learning, always assisting.


🧠 Overview

The JARVIS-Style Voice Assistant is a conceptual AI system designed to function like a cinematic, intelligent, and deeply interactive digital assistant.
It listens continuously, processes natural speech, interacts with an AI model (ChatGPT), and responds with a smooth, immersive synthetic voice.

This project focuses on design planning, architecture mapping, UI/UX, and future implementation ideas.

No code or live assistant is included — this repository is documentation and concept only.


✨ Planned Features
🎤 Voice Input

- Hotword activation (“Hey JARVIS”)

- Real-time microphone listening

- Whisper-triggered passive mode

- Noise filtering + sensitivity options

🧠 AI Processing

- Natural language understanding

- Conversation memory

- Ability to analyze, summarize, and respond

- Optional emotion tone detection

🔊 Voice Output

- Cinematic-style voice (deep, smooth, metallic)

- Response animations or UI indicator

- Adjustable personality settings

🖥️ Desktop UI / Overlay

- Floating HUD

- Visualizer (frequency bars or pulsing ring)

- Command logs

- Notifications & alerts

⚙️ Automation Features

- Open apps

- System tasks

- Clipboard reading

- Reminder creation

- Roleplay assistant mode (optional)


User speaks → Hotword triggers listening →
Speech-to-text engine transcribes →
LLM (ChatGPT) processes request →
Response generated →
TTS system converts text to cinematic voice →
Audio playback → Idle listening resumes


This section explains the conceptual logic — the repo does not include code.
